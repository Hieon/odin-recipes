        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pizza Margherita (more commonly known in English as Margherita pizza) is a typical Neapolitan pizza. The origins of Pizza Margherita came from mixing similar toppings that were was already present in Naples between 1796 and 1810. In June 1889 the pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito, Pizzeria Brandi's chef, invented a dish called "Pizza Margherita" in honor of the Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, and the Italian unification, since toppings are tomato (red), mozzarella (white) and basil (green), ingredients inspired by the colors of the national flag of Italy.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>20 fresh basil leaves, roughly torn</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>8 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cans (14-1/2 ounces each) diced tomatoes, drained</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine the oil, sugar, salt and 1 cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.</li>
            <li> Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Punch dough down; divide in half. Roll each portion into a 13-in. circle. Transfer to 2 greased 14-in. pizza pans; build up edges slightly. Cover with a clean kitchen towel; let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Spoon tomatoes over dough. Top with cheese, oregano, basil, pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil. Bake at 450° for 15-20 minutes or until crust is golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
